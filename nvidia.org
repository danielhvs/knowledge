* X Server Error Msg:
  You appear to be running an X server.  Installing the NVIDIA driver while X is running is not recommended, as doing so may prevent the installer
  from detecting some potential installation problems, and it may not be possible to start new graphics applications after a new driver is installed.
  If you choose to continue installation, it is highly recommended that you reboot your computer after installation to use the newly installed
  driver.
