* WSL localhost mapping issue

https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/6426

in the file /mnt/c/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts
put also ::1 and the thing

for example:

```bash
127.0.0.1 local.bla.org
::1       local.bla.org
```

* WSL2 problem with graphics (emacs)

sudo apt install glib

add to .bashrc:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/

* Seems to actually be some sort of issue with the terminals? So trying wlstty (they say version 3.0.5 or less does not come with the issue)

So I've tested 3.7.7 and still flashes
Now trying 3.0.2

Nope. Same issue

* Now another attempt:

I have these logs in /mnt/wslg/weston.log which correspond to the blinks:
```bash
